# Welcome to CMSK 0153 - Introduction to Angular. 
In this course, you are going to learn what an Angular framework is and how you can use it to build front-end web applications. You will learn how to create highly-reactive web applications that present an excellent user experience (UX). This course employs a project-based approach to learn Angular concepts using Microsoftâ€™s Northwind. Northwind is a fictional company created by Microsoft; it is a company of traders and customers.
 
Angular is a framework that allows you to create reactive, single-page applications. This sounds great, but what exactly does it mean? A Single Page Application (SPA) is an application that is contained within one web page - one _.html_ file. This page typically has a menu that presents links which allow for navigation from one area to another. To a user, it appears that multiple, different pages are being viewed. However, in reality, the user never leaves the page. The .html page contains JavaScript code from the server. Everything that is seen by the user - every "change" - is rendered in the browser.
 
## Why is this awesome?
It's awesome because it provides an extremely reactive UX. JavaScript operates much faster than having to reach out to a server for every page change and for every new piece of data to be displayed. Therefore, this approach allows creation of fast-responding web applications. They look and feel almost like mobile applications. Every click simply changes the single page.
 
If you do require data from a server for the page, it can simply be loaded in the background so that, still, the user never leaves the page. 
 
## How is it done?
JavaScript changes the DOM. It changes whatever is displayed in the browser by changing the HTML code during runtime (so to say). You will never see the _refresh_ icon on the screen spin because only the currently-loaded page is changing.
 
Throughout the course, you are going to learn exactly how an Angular framework does this job. Let's get started!
